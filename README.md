Welcome to the IronOS Companion repository. This repository contains the source code for the IronOS Companion application. IronOS Companion is a mobile application that allows you to control your IronOS-powered devices from your phone.

It is based on Material 3 and has beautiful built-in dark and light themes.

## Features

- [ ] Control your IronOS-powered devices from your phone
- [x] View the status of your IronOS-powered devices
- [ ] Control multiple IronOS-powered devices at once

## Getting Started

This application is built using the [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) framework. To get started, you will need to install Flutter on your machine. You can find instructions on how to do that in [the Flutter installation guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).

We use [`dprint`](https://dprint.dev) for formatting our code. It depends on the `dart` CLI being in your `PATH`, and a few more dependencies that can be installed with `dart run scripts/setup.dart`. After that, you can run `dprint check` to check if your code is formatted correctly, or `dprint fmt` to format it.
